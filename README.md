I took the source listings from the book 'Python Machine Learning Case Studies: Five Case Studies for the Data Scientist' by Danish Haroon (found here: https://github.com/Apress/python-ml-case-studies) and turned them into Jupyter Notebooks.  When I did this the datasets were also hard to find so I've included the ones I found.  There's some mismatch between them and the book making chapter03 not very useful. I am glad to see a few months later the official repository has been updated to include the datasets.  This also contains some of my notes and work on the excercises I did.

Review:
Overall I liked this book b/c it was hands on.  The lack of datasets was annoying but no longer an issue.  It was pretty restrictive to beginner stuff and thus a nice refresher for me.  I think it failed to go into details, but it's focus was on hands on case studies so this can be forgiven.  Maybe not the first machine learning book I'd recommend to a beginner, but quite possibly the second.
